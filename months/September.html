                  Ah, September. A month of cockroaches and adjusting to long distance life and work. This was the month of the suspension,
                  and between that and the roaches there was definitely a lot of stress. Even though we were both going through 
                  stuff, we still found time for each other, and did our best to settle into our separate lives. The first photo 
                  is a classic WU sunset I thought you'd like, and the second is your very cute desk setup that you sent me :) 
                  And of course, the last photo is from when Abbey and I were tipsy during naming.

                  A highlight of the month was definitely our visit! I came to Charlotte via Sweet Potato for the first time,
                  and it was nice getting to settle into a little bit of familiar domesticity for the weekend. I'd missed you a 
                  lot, of course, and it was great seeing your face in person.
