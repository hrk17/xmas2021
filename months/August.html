                  August is always my least favorite month, because it's so hot and school starts. But I got to see /you/ in 
                  August, and that really added some nice pep amongst the sweltering horror of the month. I went to Charlotte
                  and we FINALLY got some long-awaited privacy entirely on our own! It was nice seeing what domestic life looked
                  like with you for the very first time. I'm someone who tends to vomit at change because it terrifies me, and I 
                  really appreciate you being there and being patient with me as I adjusted to what Charlotte life looked like.
                  It's come around to being a fave thing of mine, but it was definitely not an easy transition, going into something 
                  entirely new during an Intense emotional time and also during August (which just makes everything worse). The 
                  double rainbow we saw felt like a Good Omen for Charlotte, and it's proven true :)
                </p>

                  Furthermore, after Charlotte, you helped with move-in at Duke! You were ridiculously helpful, and I am very grateful.
                   We didn't have much downtime that weekend, but then you surprised me and made my week the following weekend by coming 
                   down to visit! I absolutely loved getting real downtime with you, and getting to see you amidst the stress of adjusting 
                   to life in Edens with so many close friends gone from Duke. <br/>Also, we finally got to fooooooos!
