                  I'll be real, October kind of shit on me, and it was a personally awful month. It was a lot to get through, 
                  and I'm really glad we got to be together for some of the month. Seeing Wicked was definitely a hightlight â€” 
                  it was so fun getting to be fancy with you and have an IRL date, and your reactions were so adorable. A very
                  good night &lt;3
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, this month, you learned what Can You Feel The Love Tonight is about, and the third photo happend. 
                  We had a lot of fun zooms, and it was nice to get to have that time together. You also came down to Duke, and 
                  we had our darkroom date!! It was amazing being in your element with you and watching you do your photography thing. 
                  I always love looking at your photos. They're so beautiful, and the style and things you photograph just feel like You. 
                  This was also the month hulpyy was born, which feels important to note :) And finally, this is the month you went on 
                  your very cool solo camping trip!! I absolutely adored the photos you sent back, and I'm so happy you got that experience. 
                  I love you a lot, and as I said about the darkroom, I always love seeing you in your element.
