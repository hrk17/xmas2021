                  You arrived in Dallas!!! I finally got to show you my hometown. We went to White Rock Lake, visited Gail (and 
                  got baptized in the rain along the way), had coffee, went to the drive-in, and generally had a cozy and fun
                  home existence together. It was SOOOO good to see you after so long apart, and I loved every moment of having 
                  you here. Picking you up from the airport was a wonderful feeling, and we made so many good memories while you 
                  were here. I cherish all of them, and dropping you back off at the airport felt far too soon <3

                  In terms of the rest of the month, we continued our long distance vibes! Frequent texting was gr8, and 
                  you moved to Charlotte! I received many fun photos from your mom of y'all out shopping, and I love all of 
                  them. The chair one I've included on this page is a particular fave. I'm really proud of you for how you've
                  handled this huge leap into a new phase of life in a new place <3
