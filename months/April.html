                  An eventful month! We went apartment hunting in Charlotte as a ~couple~, you took me to the ER, and so much more.
                  This is the month of the infamous Psych Damage, as well as a month we took some quality time to hang out with 
                  friends, playing spikeball with Harry/Sarah and generally hanging out with Psi U. A particularly meaningful 
                  moment from this month was when you showed up to support me at LitFest! That was a very important event, and 
                  it meant the world to see you in the virtual audience :')
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was also our one year anniversary month!!! We had a wonderful day â€” a cozy morning, romantic gifts, 
                  an outing to the gardens, and a Star Wars evening. I thoroughly enjoyed celebrating a year of You and Us, and 
                  am looking forward to many more :)
