                  December has been wonderful, because I've spent almost all of it with you. I rode in the Box Turtle to come 
                  see you up in Charlotte on Dec 3, and we had some great domestic time. Finals stress was real, and I did not 
                  love 316 cutting into our quality time, but you were there and patient the whole time, and I really 
                  appreciate you bearing with me while I was not a person. The stress doesn't seem that consequential overall, 
                  though, because I've been here with /you/ and you always make anything brighter and better. I loved our 
                  outing to the little Christmas village, and our domestic cooking times with our new cute PJs. I loved 
                  ice skating with you, and I've especially loved all of our cozy evenings after finals. 
                </p>

                  I'm not ready to say goodbye again! This has been an incredible month so far, and it will be good for both of us 
                  to go be with our families, but being irl is just so much better than long distance, ya know. I've loved every moment 
                  of being here in Charlotte with you, from the bodily noises to the Christams decor to the suburban mom outings to come 
                  collect you from work. I feel like we've gotten our coexisting groove down this December, and I don't want it to end. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just one more year of long distance! Who knows what the next year will hold, or the years after that, but I do know that 
                    I choose you and will continue to do so, and I can't wait for us to keep figuring out life together. I feel like we've
                    been through a lot this year, and we've both done a lot of growing and working on growing. Life is good with you,
                    and I love you dearly, and even when we'll be apart, you'll always be there at the forefront of my heart &lt;3
