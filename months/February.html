                  In February, we settled into a bit more of a domestic routine. The semester was demanding, and things had ramped up by now,
                  but we still found time to be together. We had cozy domestic evenings, and went on a few adventures both at and outside of Duke!

                  We went out to a state park for Valentine's day, and you gave me beautiful flowers. I've never received a bouquet
                  before in my life, and it was very meaningful :) I also gave you a 3 hour haircut, and towards the end of the month,
                  we went hiking. It's always good being out in nature with the jiffy!
