                <p>
                    Dear Carrie, 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love you so very much. Over the last two-ish years of knowing you and almost two years of dating you,
                    you've genuinely made me a better and happier person, because /you/ are such a good person who knows 
                    how to find the happies in life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the moment I met you, I admired your intelligence. You have a ridiculously impressive brain, and it's 
                    something that everyone picks up on pretty swiftly upon meeting you. I love the creative things you come up 
                    with, whether it be code, a well-composed b&w shot, or extremely sweet gifts. Both in terms of pure intelligence 
                    and creativity/art, your brain is amazing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond the intelligence, though, you're such a sweet human being. You're the Mom Friend (TM) because you care 
                    deeply about people but also because people feel comfortable coming to you. You don't judge, and you're ready 
                    to be There and do your best to help people when they fall. You have the best heart, and that's something I 
                    adore about you. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You're also so fun to laugh with! You have a great sense of humor, and I feel like I'm regularly lol-ing on the 
                    floor around you. And besides just me, you make people feel comfortable opening up and being a bit goofy, and that's 
                    a trait I really love of yours. You bring out the best in people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond the personality, you're also so attractive bro. I can't even express it. You're both very cute and 
                    very hot at the same time, and it's the best. The beanie and hair are absolutely adorable, but even before your 
                    junior year makeover, back when you had different glasses and a ponytail — you were still very very cute, and 
                    10/10 I would have wanted to wife you, if I'd have known you back then.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You're a strong, sweet, thoughtful, wonderful human being who I couldn't feel luckier to be dating, or just to know 
                    and be friends with at all. &lt;3
                </p>

                <div class="textbox">
                    <p>
                        Dear Carrie, 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You make me want to be a better person. And not just in the cliche "oh you make me better!" way, but like, 
                        actually, better. There are lots of things about myself that I've been confronting this year, and none 
                        of them are fully new to me, but being with you has been the first time I've looked these things like 
                        jealousy and insecure attachment styles in the eye and realized it's time to genuinely put effort into 
                        changing them. There is a lot of unhappiness and darkness in my past that I have to grapple with in 
                        unwinding these things, and I wish it were simpler or faster to get out of patterns drilled into me 
                        over years of very shitty life-things. But it's worth diving into these things, because it makes me a better 
                        person and a better partner to you, and that's what I want to be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being in MN with you showed me what healthy and open communication looks like, and how it looks to do things 
                        like apologize without fear, or accept that you've messed up and that people still love you, anyways. It's 
                        going to continue to be a long road for me to internalize those things, and I hope you can be patient with 
                        me along the way as I learn how. You've been a good role model, and have already changed the way I move through 
                        the world and apologize and be open with people. Thank you for that. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I know I have been a part of making this year stressful for you, and I hate that — for what it's worth, I've 
                        made it stressful for me too every time I've stressed you out, and I want you to know that I'm never /not/ aware 
                        when I do something that doesn't feel good for you. I never do anything like making you feel guilty intentionally, 
                        but I can see it after it happens, and I promise I am working on getting better at it. Being with someone as 
                        wonderful and safe as you has made me realize how I was raised with my own needs and voice and boundaries constantly 
                        erased, and that I had to fight and use guilt and anything I could out of desperation to just be heard and 
                        treated with decency, because just talking or being polite never resulted in me being listened to. I've 
                        been noticing this year how that's a pattern I need to break out of, and it's been harder than I thought to 
                        break out of it, because I think growing up that way, for two decades, just imprints something fundamental in 
                        the way you view yourself. It's not even conscious instinct when I communicate unhealthily when I don't feel heard 
                        or understood — something about those situations just activates that scared child part of my brain that is 
                        very very afraid and deeply hurt from never getting to have agency unless I cried. But I acknowledge all of this, 
                        and am continuing to work on it, and I hope you will understand that I see, when I mess up, and don't like it, 
                        and am always making notes of how I can do better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's a very deep and long road for me, and it's hard to explain. Sometimes I feel ashamed of admitting these 
                        things about myself, or admitting them to you, since your immediate family is so wholesome and supportive 
                        and healthy — I worry I come across like some weird horrible person if I ever admit these things. And 
                        there's a part of me that feels like I won't know who I am anymore if I let go of these trauma responses, 
                        or like I'm invalidating the years of pain I've been through by choosing to work on forgiving and being 
                        better and happier and healthier. It's an identity crisis of sorts, and it's really difficult.
                        But I love you and want to be the best me I can be, because you are so ridiculously worth it, and that means 
                        writing this letter and telling you I see these things and want to do better. This year has been a slow 
                        process of being conscious of these things and their impact on you and us and me, and working towards 
                        doing better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love you, and thank you for choosing to stay in the sidecar of this journey with me.

                    <p>
                        Dear Carrie,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where to start? I can't believe it's already been 1 and 2/3 years. The time has gone by so fast, 
                        but also not fast enough @ the long distance parts of it all. It's wild how quickly you've come to
                        feel like home. From the moment I first met you at Psi U-lympics, my first week at Duke, I immediately 
                        felt comfortable and safe around you, and drawn to you in a "this person feels easy to be around" way. 
                        I gravitated to you at Psi U events that semester, and then boom, feelings hit during our bro convo(s).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The feelings took me by surprise, since I'd felt so comfortable and friend-y around you last semester, 
                        but also felt inevitable. You'd always felt so comfortable and good to be around, and it wasn't 
                        surprising, in hindsight, that finally sitting down to actually speak to you and look you in the eye 
                        and learn about your life smashed down a feelings wall inside of me. Beyond that, when I looked at 
                        our birth charts, your moon was exactly conjunct my sun, a ~soulmate~ aspect I'd read about but 
                        never actually seen in the wild. But it fit with what I felt for you — at home, and correct, and 
                        pulled like a magnet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was so tragic that the pandemic sent us home early, before we could start dating, but I loved the 
                        correspondence and little rituals like zoom and minecraft that we settled into. Nothing about our journey 
                        was particularly conventional, from the moment we went ham to living with you in MN to all of the 
                        long distance during a pandemic. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To go back to MN, though — that still remains one of my absolute favorite time periods in the relationship 
                        so far. The domesticity, the baking, the excursions, the cuddling and romantic exploring... it all felt 
                        so good, and made me so happy amidst pandemic- and Duke-related stress. I'm so so glad I chose to join you up 
                        in MN, and that you came and braved a tornado to come collect me like a parcel. Romantic corn gf &lt;3 
                        Getting to spend so much time with your family changed my life, as you've seen (or will see) in the other letters, 
                        and it was so special feeling included by you guys. You made me fall in love with the cold cheese 
                        region of the US, and it was incredible being there with you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next semester, Spring 2021, was a strange one. I think we were both deeply stressed a lot of the time, 
                        and generally about opposite things. We started having to confront the less fun parts of a relationship, like 
                        communicating about difficult things and learning what hurts the other when we hadn't really been 
                        exposed to that in the bubble of MN. Pandemic stress, graduation, classes, and completely opposite social needs 
                        and no real experience communicating with each other about those things all hit at once, and I think anyone 
                        would struggle in our shoes. But we made it through, and I'm really grateful for all the cozy evenings and outings 
                        we got along the way, even in spite of what a crazy semester it was for both of us. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This summer and fall, we've definitely continued with our share of figuring ourselves and each other out. It's 
                        hard to do that in a normal relationship, and being long distance definitely adds stress. But they're all 
                        important things to do, and they're growing pains that I'm so ridiculously willing to take on, because anything 
                        is worth it, with you, and these things will only become easier and make everything ~healthy~ and ~good~ in the 
                        long run. Just speaking for myself, I've eaten several pies worth of humble pie (not even just slices man, whole pies) 
                        as various circumstances have made me confront the parts of myself I need to work on this year, and it's 
                        been difficult and teary at times as I've looked at parts of myself I've never looked on so consciously before. 
                        It was also really hard trying to be more mindful and conscious of myself and my words and actions as so many 
                        difficult things happened, like my grandfather dying and living with roaches (aka one of my biggest fears) and 
                        literally not getting quality sleep for a whole semester because of loud party people. It's been a pressure 
                        cooker at times, and I'm grateful that you've been willing to stick it out with me and sit in the metaphorical 
                        fryer with me. 
                    <p>
                        I know adjusting to work and Charlotte has also been really difficult and isolating for you, as it 
                        would for literally anyone in your shoes. I've hated seeing you struggle from so far away, but I'm so 
                        proud of all the strides you've made in Charlotte. You don't always see the good things about yourself 
                        clearly, like how very very cool and 
                        awesome you are, so I'm here to tell you: the progress you've made in ramping up at work and becoming a 
                        full-stack wizard is SO impressive, and I'm very impressed at how you've been able to identify ways to 
                        make living in Charlotte feel better, like going on your insanely cool solo hike and going into the office 
                        some days. You're doing so, so well, and I feel immense pride in watching you find your footing in this new town,
                        in this new life. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope that we can both continue to grow together for a long time. Growing this past year has not been easy 
                        and I've not always been successful at it, personally, but there's no one I would rather do it with than you. You mean 
                        so ridiculously much to me as a friend and a girlfriend. I love laughing with you till it hurts; I love 
                        lazy cozy mornings being held by you (everything in the world always feels completely right and safe, in those 
                        moments); I love being around you, vibing, both of us doing our own thing and just existing quietly together. 
                        I'm insanely fond of you, and love you very dearly, my chief. 2021 was certainly an interesting year, and 
                        I'm looking forward to whatever 2022 has in store. The long distance is not ideal, but again, it's with 
                        you, so I choose that option emphatically, and will cherish all the moments we get together, whether they are 
                        physically in person, or online in a zoom room. I'm very frond of you &lt;3
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yours always, <br/>
                        Hannah
