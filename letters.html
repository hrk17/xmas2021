                <p>
                    Dear Carrie, <br/>
                    I love you so very much. Over the last two-ish years of knowing you and almost two years of dating you,
                    you've genuinely made me a better and happier person, because /you/ are such a good person who knows 
                    how to find the happies in life. <br/>
                    From the moment I met you, I admired your intelligence. You have a ridiculously impressive brain, and it's 
                    something that everyone picks up on pretty swiftly upon meeting you. I love the creative things you come up 
                    with, whether it be code, a well-composed b&w shot, or extremely sweet gifts. Both in terms of pure intelligence 
                    and creativity/art, your brain is amazing. <br/>
                    Beyond the intelligence, though, you're such a sweet human being. You're the Mom Friend (TM) because you care 
                    deeply about people but also because people feel comfortable coming to you. You don't judge, and you're ready 
                    to be There and do your best to help people when they fall. You have the best heart, and that's something I 
                    adore about you. <br/>
                    You're also so fun to laugh with! You have a great sense of humor, and I feel like I'm regularly lol-ing on the 
                    floor around you. Beyond just me, you make people feel comfortable opening up and being a bit goofy, and that's 
                    a trait I really love of yours. <br/>
                    Beyond the personality, you're also so attractive bro. I can't even express it. You're both very cute and 
                    very hot at the same time, and it's the best. The beanie and hair are absolutely adorable, but even before your 
                    junior year makeover, back when you had different glasses and a ponytail — you were still very very cute, and 
                    10/10 I would have wanted to wife you, if I'd known you back then. <br/>
                    You're a strong, sweet, thoughtful, wonderful human being who I couldn't feel luckier to be dating, or just to know 
                    and be friends with at all. &lt;3

                    <p>
                        Dear Carrie, <br/>
                        You make me want to be a better person. And not just in the cliche "oh you make me better!" way, but like, 
                        actually, better. There are lots of things about myself that I've been confronting this year, and none 
                        of them are fully new to me, but being with you has been the first time I've looked these things like 
                        jealousy and insecure attachment styles in the eye and realized it's time to genuinely put effort into 
                        changing them. There is a lot of unhappiness and darkness in my past that I have to grapple with in 
                        unwinding these things, and I wish it were simpler or faster to get out of patterns drilled into me 
                        over years of very shitty life-things. But it's worth diving into these things, because it makes me a better 
                        person and a better partner to you, and that's what I want to be. <br/>
                        Being in MN with you showed me what healthy and open communication looks like, and how it looks to do things 
                        like apologize without fear, or accept that you've messed up and that people still love you, anyways. It's 
                        going to continue to be a long road for me to internalize those things, and I hope you can be patient with 
                        me along the way as I learn how. You've been a good role model, and have already changed the way I move through 
                        the world and apologize and be open with people. Thank you for that. <br/>
                        I know I have been a part of making this year stressful for you, and I hate that — for what it's worth, I've 
                        made it stressful for me too every time I've stressed you out, and I want you to know that I'm never /not/ aware 
                        when I do something that doesn't feel good for you. I never do anything like making you feel guilty intentionally, 
                        but I can see it after it happens, and I promise I am working on getting better at it. Being with someone as 
                        wonderful and safe as you has made me realize how I was raised with my own needs and voice and boundaries constantly 
                        erased, and that I had to fight and use guilt and anything I could out of desperation to just be heard and 
                        treated with decency, because just talking or being polite never resulted in me being listened to. I've 
                        been noticing this year how that's a pattern I need to break out of, and it's been harder than I thought to 
                        break out of it, because I think growing up that way, for two decades, just imprints something fundamental in 
                        the way you view yourself. It's not even conscious instinct when I communicate unhealthily when I don't feel heard 
                        or understood — something about those situations just activates that scared child part of my brain that is 
                        very very afraid and deeply hurt from never getting to have agency unless I cried. But I acknowledge all of this, 
                        and am continuing to work on it, and I hope you will understand that I see, when I mess up, and don't like it, 
                        and am always making notes of how I can do better. <br/>
                        It's a very deep and long road for me, and it's hard to explain. Sometimes I feel ashamed of admitting these 
                        things about myself, or admitting them to you, since your immediate family is so wholesome and supportive 
                        and healthy — I worry I come across like some weird horrible person if I ever admit these things. But I 
                        love you and want to be the best me I can be, because you are so ridiculously worth it, and that means 
                        writing this letter and telling you I see these things and want to do better. This year has been a slow 
                        process of being conscious of these things and their impact on you and us and me, and working towards 
                        doing better.
